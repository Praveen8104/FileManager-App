## üì≤ Platform Details

- **Built with:**

  - Expo SDK (FileSystem, Sharing, IntentLauncher, LocalAuthentication, DocumentPicker)  
  - MaterialCommunityIcons

- **Supported Platforms:**  
  - Android  
  - iOS

## üõ† Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 16.x  
- Expo CLI (`npm install -g expo-cli`)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

git clone https://github.com/Praveen8104/FileManager-App.git


2. **Install Dependencies**

npm install


3. **Run the App**

npx expo start




## üìÇ Project Structure

- `HomeScreen.js`  
Main screen and logic for the file manager, including all features.

- `components/`  
All presentational sub-components (FileItem, FloatingActionButton, etc.).

- `utils/`  
Helper functions (bytes formatter, icon/color inference, etc.).

## üîí Security Notes

- **Files are managed within the sandboxed storage** (`expo-file-system` document directory) for privacy.
- **Biometric authentication** (if enabled) is required on app open.  
If authentication fails, the app closes immediately.
- **Files remain local on device;** sharing uses OS-level APIs.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Highlights

- **Intuitive interface:** Touch-friendly, adaptive layout.
- **Smart clipboard:** Prevents duplicate overwrites with intelligent naming, allows cross-folder move/copy.
- **Global search:** Ultra-fast, recursive across all subfolders.
- **Highly customizable:** User toggle for dark mode and biometrics.
- **User-friendly batch actions:** Multi-select mode for organization and sharing.
